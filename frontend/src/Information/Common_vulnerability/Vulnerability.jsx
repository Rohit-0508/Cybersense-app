                    A vulnerability is a future threat to an organization’s security. If an attacker identifies and exploits the vulnerability, then the costs to the organization and its customers can be significant. For example, data breaches and ransomware attacks commonly have price tags in the millions of dollars.
                    <br /><br />
                    Identifying vulnerabilities before they are exploited by an attacker is a much more cost-effective approach to vulnerability management. The sooner that vulnerabilities are identified and remediated in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), the lower the cost to the organization. This is one of the main reasons why many organizations are working to adopt DevSecOps and shift security left initiatives.

                    <li><span>Zero-Day Vulnerabilities: </span>
                        A zero-day vulnerability is a weak point within a system or piece of software that cybercriminals discover before a patch fixing the weakness is available.</li>

                    <li><span> Unpatched Software: </span>
                        Patching software and then releasing an updated version of the software is a common practice, meant to optimize the software’s performance and security. However, the original version of the software is left unpatched and remains open to vulnerabilities.</li>

                    <li><span> Application Misconfiguration: </span>
                        Software often allows users to configure settings to their liking, including whether they wish to enable or disable its security features. Disabling these features can expose users to potential cyber attacks. This vulnerability tends to be of particular concern in cloud-based environments.</li>

                    <li><span> Remote Code Execution: </span>
                        Remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities allow cybercriminals to infiltrate a vulnerability with malicious code and then control the code from a remote machine. This tactic can be used to steal data, but it can also enable a cybercriminal to take over a machine. These attacks can be automated, making them an example of why it’s increasingly important to understand the relationship between cybersecurity and AI.</li>

                    <li><span> Credential Theft: </span>
                        Cybercriminals trick individuals via a phishing email to steal their credentials and use them to access the user’s system. They also employ old passwords uncovered in previously exposed data breaches to gain access.</li>

                <header><h2>How To Stay Protected Against Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities</h2></header>
                Some cybersecurity vulnerabilities are inevitable and will always be a problem for organizations. However, most vulnerabilities can be mitigated to prevent cybercriminals from exploiting them. Organizations can reduce cybersecurity vulnerabilities by doing the following.
                <ul style={{paddingBottom:'8pc'}}>
                    <li>
                        <span>Keep software up to date</span><br /><br />Common cybersecurity vulnerabilities that cybercriminals exploit come from outdated or unpatched software. However, applications regularly create software updates that patch known security vulnerabilities and add security features to better protect your device. An organization should keep its software up to date to prevent cybercriminals from exploiting security vulnerabilities found within their software.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>Practice cybersecurity best practices</span><br /><br />Some cybersecurity vulnerabilities are the result of human error. An organization can reduce its risk from security vulnerabilities by having its employees exercise cybersecurity best practices.

                        A common security vulnerability caused by human error is weak login credentials. Cybercriminals can easily crack weak credentials to gain unauthorized access to an organization’s network. Employees should use strong and unique passwords to make them difficult for cybercriminals to compromise. A strong password includes at least 16 characters and a unique combination of letters, numbers and special characters. It omits any personal information, sequential numbers or letters and commonly used dictionary words.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>Implement least-privilege access</span><br /><br />The principle of least privilege reduces the security vulnerabilities caused by poor access control. The principle of least privilege is a cybersecurity concept in which users are given just enough privileged access to resources they need to do their jobs and no more. By implementing least-privilege access, organizations can reduce the attack surface that cybercriminals can target to breach their systems. If a threat actor were to infiltrate an organization’s systems, least privilege access would prevent lateral movement and limit the access of the threat actor.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>Secure WiFi networks</span><br /><br />Cybercriminals frequently exploit inadequate or nonexistent encryption, including data transmitted on unencrypted WiFi networks. Organizations need to secure their WiFi by protecting it with a strong password, keeping their router’s software up to date and turning on WPA3 or WPA2 encryption – WiFi encryption protocols that protect web traffic.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>Run a penetration test</span><br /><br />A penetration test is a security exercise that simulates a cyber attack on an organization’s security systems. It tests the strength of an organization’s security measures and identifies any security vulnerabilities that cybercriminals can exploit. By running a penetration test, an organization can determine what security protocols are working and what vulnerabilities they need to patch. A penetration test can identify all types of security vulnerabilities, from human error to software bugs, and help organizations remedy them.
